# Reqres API Test Scenarios

This document provides a comprehensive list of positive and negative test scenarios for the [Reqres API](https://reqres.in). The API is used for demonstrating RESTful requests and responses with a dummy data set. These test cases cover user management, resource retrieval, registration, and login functionalities.

## Test Scenarios

The table below outlines the test cases, including the endpoint, test type (positive/negative), description, expected behavior, and assertions.

## Usage

You can use these test scenarios to verify the functionality of the Reqres API using tools like:
- **Postman**
- **cURL**
- **Automated Testing Frameworks** (e.g., PyTest, JUnit, or RestAssured)

## Notes

- Ensure that the API endpoints are accessible when performing these tests.
- Response times may vary based on network conditions.
